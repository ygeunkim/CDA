# Generalized Linear Models for Counts and Rates

It is natural to assume the count data

$$Y \sim Poisson(\mu)$$

## Poisson Loglinear Models

As mentioned, we build a GLM with

1. The _random component_: $Y \sim Poisson(\mu)$
2. The _systematic component_: $\alpha + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p$
3. The _link function_: log-link $\ln(\mu)$ which is canonical link for a Poisson GLM

$$\ln\mu(\mathbf{x}) = \alpha + \beta_1x_1 + \cdots + \beta_px_p$$

For an interpretation perspective,

$$\mu(\mathbf{x}) = \exp(\alpha + \beta_1x_1 + \cdots + \beta_px_p) = e^\alpha(e^{\beta_1})^{x_1}\cdots(e^{\beta_p})^{x_p}$$

i.e. $\mu$ is multiplied by $e^{\beta_j}$ as $x_j$ increases by 1-unit. $x_j$ has a _multiplicative impact_ of $e^{\beta_j}$ on $\mu$.


## Horseshoe crab mating data

```{r, message=FALSE}
(crab <- read_table("data/Crabs.dat"))
```

```{r}
crab %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = width, y = sat) +
  geom_hex() +
  labs(
    x = "Carapace width",
    y = "Number of satellites"
  )
```

- Large variability is observed.
- Outlier: analysis with this observation and without it

For clarification,

```{r}
(width_interval <-
  crab %>%
  group_by(width = cut(width,
                       breaks = c(0, seq(23.25, 29.25, by = 1), Inf),
                       ordered_result = TRUE)) %>%
  summarise(cases = n(), S = sum(sat), Mean = mean(sat), Variance = var(sat)))
```

Looking at the table, we can see the _nonlinear relationship_ between sateliite counts and width.



```{r}
crab %>%
  group_by(width = cut(width,
                       breaks = c(0, seq(23.25, 29.25, by = 1), Inf),
                       ordered_result = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = width, y = sat, fill = width) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE)
```

### Logistic regression model

Consider binary response

$$Y = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if satellite}\: > 0 \\ 0 & \text{if satellite}\: = 0 \end{cases}$$

```{r}
crab %>%
  select(y, width)
```

For $\pi(x) = P(Y = 1) = \mu$,

$$\text{logit}\pi(x) \equiv \ln\frac{\pi(x)}{1 - \pi(x)} = \alpha + \beta x$$

```{r}
logistic_fit <-
  crab %>%
  glm(y ~ width, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = .)
summary(logistic_fit)
```

Estimated odds of having satellites for each unit change in `width` is multiplied by

$$\frac{\hat\pi}{1 - \hat\pi} = \exp(\hat\beta) = 1.64$$

### Poisson regression

Consider count response

$$Y = \text{the number of satellites} \sim Poisson(\mu)$$

```{r}
crab %>%
  select(sat, width)
```


```{r}
pois_fit <-
 crab %>%
  glm(sat ~ width, data = ., family = poisson(link = "log"))
summary(pois_fit)
```

### Goodness-of-fit

Deviance of _exponential family_ can be given by

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
D(\mathbf{y}, \boldsymbol{\hat\mu}) & := -2(L_M - L_S) \\
& = LRT \quad\text{for}\: H_0: M \\
& = 2\sum_i\frac{y_i\tilde\theta_i - b(\tilde\theta_i)}{a(\phi)} - 2\sum_i\frac{y_i\hat\theta_i - b(\hat\theta_i)}{a(\phi)} \\
& \text{where}\quad \tilde\theta = \text{of saturated, and} \quad \hat\theta = \text{of the current model}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

For $a(\phi) = \frac{\phi}{w_i}$, we compute _scaled deviance_

$$\frac{D(\mathbf{y}, \boldsymbol{\hat\mu)}}{\phi} \approx \chi^2$$

It can be simplified in the Poisson GLM as

$$D(\mathbf{y}, \boldsymbol{\hat\mu}) = 2\sum_i\ln\frac{y_i}{\hat\mu_i}$$

To measure the goodness-of-fit, **analysis of deviance** can be conducted. Comparing two nested models with $\phi = 1$, construct a test

$$M_0: \text{simpler model} \qquad\text{vs}\quad M_1: \text{complex model}$$

where $M_0$ is _nested within_ $M_1$. For each model, we can obtain scaled deviance written as

$$D_0 \equiv D(\mathbf{y}, \boldsymbol{\hat\mu_0}) \le D(\mathbf{y}, \boldsymbol{\hat\mu_1}) \equiv D_1$$

Then _likelihood-ratio-test statistic_ is applicable to the above test structure

$$G^2(M_0 \mid M_1) = D_0 - D_1 \stackrel{H_0}{\approx} \chi^2(\text{difference of parameters})$$

In case of canonical link GLMs,

$$G^2(M_0 \mid M_1) = 2\sum_i\hat\mu_{1i}\ln\frac{\hat\mu_{1i}}{\hat\mu_{0i}}$$

```{r}
anova(pois_fit, test = "LRT")
```

Here,

$$M_0: \text{null model} \qquad\text{vs}\quad M_1: \text{only width}$$

For this hypothesis, reject $M_0$, i.e. the fit of null model is poor compared to the current model. However, the size of residual deviance seems quite large while its degrees of freedom is only `1`.

### Residual analysis

We now examine residual analysis. In general, _standardized Pearson residual_ is prefered.

$$r_i = \frac{y_i - \hat\mu_i}{\sqrt{V(\hat\mu_i)(1 - \hat{h}_i)}} = \frac{e_i}{\sqrt{V(\hat\mu_i)(1 - \hat{h}_i)}}$$

where $\hat{h}_i$ is the hat values.

```{r}
pois_resid <- residuals(pois_fit) / sqrt(1 - hatvalues(pois_fit))
summary(pois_resid)
```

```{r}
autoplot(pois_fit)
```

- Three large residuals can be observed.
- The set of $r_i$ seems variable.

It cannot be said to be a good fit.

### Overdispersion for Poisson GLMs

```{r}
width_interval
```


Theoretically, for Poisson distribution,

$$E(Y) = Var(Y) = \mu$$

However as we can see, sample variance(`Variance`) is much larger than sample mean(`Mean`). In this data set, `width` is not the only predictor that affects the response. Not only that, but also `weight`, `color`, and `spine` can be in the systematic component. Thus, $\mu$ is varied for each combination of $(\text{width, weight, color, spine})^T = \mathbf{x}$. We now have _conditional distribution_

$$Y \mid \mu \sim Poisson(\mu)$$

which gives

$$E(Y \mid \mu) = Var(Y \mid \mu) = \mu$$

Let

$$\theta := E(\mu)$$

Then

$$E(Y) = E\big[E(Y \mid \mu)\big] = E(\mu) = \theta$$

and

$$Var(Y) = E\big[ Var(Y \mid \mu) \big] + Var\big[ E(Y \mid \mu) \big] = E(\mu) + Var(\mu) > \theta$$

Hence,

$$Var(Y) > E(Y)$$

### Negative Binomial GLMs

Negative binomial distribution which also takes into account count response can be a good candidates. Let $Y$ be the negative binomial random variable with parameters $\mu$ and $\gamma = \frac{1}{k}$. Then

$$E(Y) = \mu \quad < Var(Y) = \mu + \gamma\mu^2$$

Here, $\gamma > 0$ is called _dispersion parameter_. `MASS` library enables to fit the negative binomial random component and corresponding link functions.
